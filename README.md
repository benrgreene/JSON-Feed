# JSON Feed Plugin

This is a plugin for the SPA framework adding an API endpoint that delivers a feed (similar to an RSS Feed) using JSON instead of XML. 

The endpoint is `www.mysite.com/api/get/jsonFeed`

## Options

* `json_description`: This is the description set as the site description in the feed

## Filters

* `json/post-types`: sets the post types to be sent in the feed (future release)
